This repo was originally a folder on a ISE_14.7VM (Oracle Linux 6 with VirtualBox 5) folder containing all of my ISE Projects.
Later, i decided to finally add them to github to make it possible to share with other people.
However, all this projects are part of my research as a research assistant on CEPOF - USP (Brazil), so they lack any internal documentation, and also include debug files and other stuff like that.
Since my focus is on maintaining my research, i will not be able to keep a well documented repo, and it is most probably only understandable through my research publications themself, which may serve as external documentation.
Anyway, i keep it here so that I'm able to share this content with other, since ISE_14.7VM and the Xilinx related tools are outdated and don't provide a better way of doing this (and I obviously couldn't include all this code on my research publications).
